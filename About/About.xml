  <description>Spruce up your colonists' bedrooms with a selection of different colours for all sizes of bed.

● Beds of all sizes now have red, yellow, green, blue, and purple variants
● Beds now require an amount of cloth to build - the bigger or grander the bed, the more cloth is needed

Note: Don't enable this mod as well as T-MoreBedsVanilla; just pick one.
Note: New beds added by this mod do not recolour when set to prisoner or medical use.</description>
